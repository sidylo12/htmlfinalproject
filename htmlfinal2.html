    <h1>senegal before being colonised </h1>
    
 <p>  The establishment of Senegal as a French colony is merely one part of the French colonial effort in west Africa during the 1880s and 1890s. By 1895 there are no fewer than six French colonies in the region, covering a vast unbroken stretch of the continent. In that year they are grouped together as French West Africa.
     Among them Senegal is the colony with the strongest French presence. Dakar, founded by the French in 1857 on the mainland opposite the island of Gor√©e, becomes the capital of the territory in 1902 (succeeding St Louis in the role). Senegal therefore remains at the centre of France's west African empire, until all the separate colonies win their independence in 1960.</p>
