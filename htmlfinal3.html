    <p> Since Senegal attained independence in 1960, the country has functioned with a liberal democratic, constitutional system of government. A multi-party system has been the norm of the Senegalese polity. One legacy of the country's colonial history is that Senegal has produced one of Africa's best intelligentsia. Senegal is a country of ethnic and religious diversity, which has a cosmopolitan outlook on issues. It has, on the whole, a tradition of pluralism, with a highly-organized civil society, including trade unionists, students, academics and other professionals. The pluralistic character of the society is expressed through the lively, albeit often elitist, discourse which is reflected in the spectrum of print media which exists in the country. Senegal has also had strong legal and political institutions since independence.</p>
